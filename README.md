## Pull request practice

This repo is for part 2 of the beginner DeCal's Git/version control lab. Fork
the repo, open README.md and edit the sentence below so that it says your name
instead of "Tux the Penguin", and submit a pull request!
*I did it on the website so this sentence is just another edit through Vim*
```
Hello, my name is Nathan Lin and I just made a pull request!
